# VelvetFlow

**VelvetFlow** is a novel multi-density clustering and robust outlier detection framework designed to handle datasets with diverse density profiles. By partitioning data into high-density and low-density subsets, applying specialized clustering algorithms, and leveraging a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)-based outlier detection method, VelvetFlow achieves high-fidelity clustering and effective anomaly isolation across varied real-world datasets.


## Features

- **Multi-Density Clustering**: Effectively clusters datasets with regions of varying densities.
- **Robust Outlier Detection**: Identifies anomalies using a scaled Minimum Spanning Tree approach combined with \(k\)-NN verification.
- **High Performance**: Demonstrates superior clustering quality (NMI, ARI) compared to traditional density-based methods.
